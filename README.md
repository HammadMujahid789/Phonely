# Introduction
Phonely is one of the fastest growing Refurbished Mobile Company in Ireland. In fact, the whole concept behind what they do is based on finding new ways for customers to save. Ever since opening of their first location in 2018, Phonely has brought innovation to the world of refurbished electronics changing the way devices are bought and sold. Born out of vision and a desire to answer the needs of customers wanting to have the best and save the most, Phonely has continued to grow, consistently providing customers with great new opportunities.

The company began with a simple concept and an idea to revolutionize the phone industry by turning used phones into new value for customers looking to upgrade their devices while saving money at the same time. People around the world save every day by taking advantage of the opportunity used goods offer, from vintage clothing to used vehicles. Buying used is a great way to save money and protect the environment by reusing and keeping fewer items from the landfill, but there has been a lack of resources for customers seeking used electronics.

Phonely pioneered a concept called reCommerce making it easier for customers to get quality refurbished electronic items at a discounted price. When they opened their first store selling certified, refurbished devices, customers responded to the great value and benefit over buying overpriced new smartphones. Since then, more and more people have come to appreciate the unique opportunity we offer and enjoy our like-new products at a fraction of the cost.

Phonely has grown into a successful e-commerce company with a large fanbase of happy customers. After becoming one of the leading renewed electronics sites in the Netherlands, Phonely expanded to bring savings to a wider audience. Now, proudly serving the people of Ireland. Phonely are excited to keep growig and seeking new ways
to serve you and your community.

# Recommendations

Cloud Computing services are changing the way information technology is being used by public institutions and private organizations. Today, there are a variety of cloud computing services to fulfil almost any IT requirement. Organizations typically pay only for the cloud service they use, helping them reduce operating costs and run infrastructure more efficiently. There are four different types of services usuing used in cloud:

1-Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
2-Product as a Service (PaaS)
3-Software as a Service (SaaS)
4-Function as a Service (FaaS)

Phonely is currently not using any kind of cloud service. This company is currently occupying a non-cloud infrastructure. I would recommend them to get Product as a Service(PaaS).

**Product as a Service (PaaS)**
This cloud computing service is an advanced version of IaaS. Apart from just providing the IT infrastructure, PaaS also provides the computing platform and solution stack as a service. It is joined by different more features like repair or replace.With the help of Paas company can offer products in different subscription models.
Company can have a strong ongoing engagement and and closer customer support. Insted of paying a a fee one time, companies can offer daily, weekly,monthly and yearly subscriptions Most of the products we use in our daily life come in part of (PaaS).

**Cloud vs Non-Cloud**
In today's world, most of the large companies store their data in cloud and they even provide their cloud services to smaller companies. Cloud infrastructure can be very useful for any business. When you choose an application or softare which is going to be utilized by an entire enterprie, you have the choice to host it on your own tool or on someone's cloud. The difference betweeen these two is given below:

**Non- Cloud**:
In non-cloud system, the server is located in your own permises i.e "Locally Hosted System".  The benefits are more direct control of the equipment, but with an initial server purchase and setup cost, software license fees, and ongoing server maintenance costs borne by you.You also have to secure the server and its data, which becomes particularly important if the data contains personally identifiable information (PII).

**Cloud**:
In cloud based system, your server is located in the data centre stored by your own provider like Googel, Microsoft and Amazon etc. This system is alot simpler than the non cloud for you to add or remove data on your server. The environment is secured tby the company providing you the cloud services.
